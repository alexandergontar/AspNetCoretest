Here is a crossplatform mobile application based on the Xamarin framework.
The interface is quite simple and self explainatory. There are two toggle switches
in the "Settings" menu:
the Auto mode - to set the temperarure setpoint and 
the Monitor mode - for continuous temperature/humidity monitoring.
