The Web Interface.
It allows remote control through a Web browser of a PC, Laptop or a mobile device.
The initial connection to a local Wi-Fi network is also established through it.
To do this power up the microcontroller. Connect to it in AP mode 
(SSID starts with ESP8266..). 
Find the security key in the controller  C++ source code line 94:
 WiFi.softAP("ESP8266", "yourpassword");
As connection has been established type "192.168.4.1" in your browser's url field 
and you'll see a web page (see pic. below). 
To connect to a local Wi-Fi network click on the Wi-Fi options button, enter
the SSID and password of your network and click on Save. After that wait a few seconds while the web page
is refreshing. If connection is success an IP-address of the microcontroller in the local Wi-Fi
network will be displayed. Otherwise you'll see an error code.
Now you can close the AP connection and reconnect to the device
in your local network at the displayed address.
