Desktop.
Here above we can see a desktop application for remote control of the climat
device. The Monitor/Stop button is used for continuous monitoring.
It's interface is rather intuitive and self descriptive. The Wi-Fi button is not used
in this project. You can find the Microsoft Visual Studio project of it at the following link:
https://github.com/alexandergontar/ClientSocket/tree/main/ClientSocket/ClientSocket
or just click on blue ">>>>>>>>>>>>>" below.
Those who don't want to modify it with the Microsoft Visual Studio may go directly to the Release folder
and launch it by clicking the ClientSocket.exe file.
